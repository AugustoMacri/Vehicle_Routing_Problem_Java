1. Create Client object to store all clients from benchmarks
    - Clients need to have id, x, y, demand, distance, readyTime, dueDate, serviceTime

2. We have to implement the function to read all the benchmarks
    - We had to implement a ProblemInstance that store de instances of the problem

3. Now we need to implement a configuration file, this file will store all variables that we will need

4. We need to implement the initialization em subPop distribution
